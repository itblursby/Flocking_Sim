# Flocking Simulation
Hi everyone!
This is a flocking simulation built in Java using the Processing library.
##To run:
You will need:
* Java 8 (or another compatible version of Java, not sure which ones work, Java 16 does not work)
* The Processing 3 library (or at least the jar file)\
cd into your folder, and then type in
```shell
$ java -cp "[path to jar file]/core.jar:./bin" FlockingSim
```
where [path to jar file] is where your core.jar file is located.
